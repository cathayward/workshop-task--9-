- i couldn’t really decide what i wanted to do with the live video function but after playing around with it, i was inspired by the look of a pixelated video and it’s link to video games.
- i decided then, to move the pixelated video to the centre of the screen and behind it, i pixelated an image of a nintendo ds and added that in.
- i then utilised fonts to create a small text that says: choose your character!
- i ran into a lot of issues, especially when it came to moving the pixelated video around instead of having it fit to the exact canvas size, but with a little help from chatGPT i was able to achieve this easily. i essentially asked chatGPT to look through the code and help me find a way to edit the position of the pixelated video and it gave me a response that I modified marginally in order to achieve the effect that I wanted.
- one thing i really struggled with was trying to make sure the video was centered on the ds and decided i just had to make a singular canvas size rather than allowing it to change with the window size as i would’ve preferred.
    - this way the ds and the video wouldn’t scale no matter what size window the viewer was looking at it through.
- one weird thing i noticed was that when i tried to set the image mode to center, the original video popped up despite me hiding it, i tried to find a way to remedy this but it didn’t seem doable, at least to me, and thus i just adjusted the image manually so it was centered.
- i am really happy with the way this turned out and though nintendo ds handhelds had slightly better graphics than this, i still like the nostalgia that the imagery brings out.
